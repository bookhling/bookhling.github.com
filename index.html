			<p>One mtDNA sequence per child.</p>
			<p>I'm working at the Genspace community biotechnology lab night and day to bring one mitochondrial DNA sequence per child program to schools in New York City area. The students would go through the processes involved in extracting, amplifying, and sequencing their own DNA step by step. They will then learn how to use modern software tools to gather meaningful information from their own genetic sequences, using publicly available databases on the net.</p>

			<p>High Altitude Microbial Sampling Station: HAMSS</p>
			<p>HAMSS is a collaboration with Dr.Oliver Medvedik of Genspace community biolab and Dr.Chris Mason of Weill Cornell Medical College to launch a high altitude air sampling station using off-the-shelf weather balloon. It is designed to take air samples at the stratospheric altitude of 30km, seal itself to protect against contamination, and drop down to surface for retrieval. The sample will then go through metagenomic sequencing and analysis for presence of biosphere at high altitudes normally thought to be unfit for life. We plan to eventually roll out the project in kit form for students and amateur scientists across the world</p>

			<p>Synthetic Biology Bridge Program</p>
			<p>This is a collaboration among a number of igem participants, educators, academics and myself to create a comprehensive introductory synthetic biology course for high school level students. It will make extensive use of software frameworks for analyzing and constructing biological circuits. The students are expected to be able to build their own simple living systems and know how to apply their simulated systems in a real lab, culminating in a genuine living organism they designed and built themselves. Synthetic Biology Bridge Program is a collaboration between different nonprofit entities that reviews applications from local high school level students and selects a very small number of candidates based solely on the merit of their research proposal. The program provides full funding, lab access, and academic adviors to accepted students. If you are interested in either participating or supporting the program in any form feel free to <a href=mailto:sung@syn.li>contact me</a>.</p>

			<p>SynBio Bridge Software Suite</p>
			<p>SynBio Bridge software suite is a Gensapce skunkworks initiave born from efforts of 2011 NYC iGEM software team, rewritten to be compatible with the synthetic biology brige program to provide better tools for intermidiate biohackers and students to learn and practice synthetic biology. After years of dead-ends in integrating CAD based paradigm of synthetic biology design program that's supposed to be both useful to professional scientists as well as student requiring integrated teaching tool, I think we've hit an interesting turning point in how to approach the problem. The software, still in pre-alpha state, will be demonstrated and tested out in NYC World Maker Faire, and Maker Faire Africa in Cairo.</p>

			<p>Quantum dot biolaser</p>
			<p>An offshoot of the 2011 Genspace iGEM collaboration effort, this is an attempt to apply the highly publicized Nature Photonics paper on creation of a biolaser using E.coli cells producing GFP to quantum dot producing cell line created by myself and the iGEM team. Quantum dots have much broader spectrum of absorption and incredibly narrow emission rate, which should help in producing far superior quality biolaser system.</p>

			<p>Satellite</p>

			<p>Life as physical systems</p>
			<p>There are a number of experiments I'm planning that utilizes synthetic biology as a tool to experiment with living systems in within context of physics, rather than biology. Imagine microbial life forms and lasers, together at last. The 2009 Harvard iGEM project is one of the inspirations. I will also explore different methods of working with artifical vesicles as shell for protocell models.</p>
